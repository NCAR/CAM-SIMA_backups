The script newCAM_namelist.py was written by Steve Goldhaber.  It requires namelist_defaults_cam.xml and namelist_definition_old.xm. to exist in the directory where this python script will be run.

To run it:  "python newCAM_namelist.py"

Current limitations:

- The SILHS namelist has "%" in some of their namelist names, which is a prohibited variable within this tool.  In the 
exomple namelist_defaults_cam.xml file included here, these variables have been commented out.

-  All namelist names which do not reside in namelist_defaults_cam.xml file cause an error and are listed when this tool is run.  
They need to be commented out, removed or a definition needs to be added.  The thought is once this is done, the script will do the
conversion.  The "aircraft_co2_file" section has been disabled to prove that removing this variable gets rid of the error message.
