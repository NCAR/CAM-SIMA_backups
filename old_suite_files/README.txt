These files were the first attempt at writing Suite Definition Files (SDFS) for CAM.  However,
while helpful as a reference, they are generally out-of-date enough that they are likely not beneficial
for CAM-SIMA or any other CCPP-enabled host model as actual SDF files.  Thus once a "real" SDF file
exists in atmospheric_physics for that version, then the corresponding SDF here should probably be deleted.
