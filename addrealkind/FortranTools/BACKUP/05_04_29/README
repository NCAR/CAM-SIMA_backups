THINGS TO DO TO GET AUTO-TRANSLATION OF REAL DECLARATIONS AND REAL LITERAL 
CONSTANTS TO USE "kind"

 - Add driver to run this on all *.[Ff] and *.[Ff]90 files beneath a 
   specified directory.  
   - Start testing with WRF, CAM, SMS, etc.  
 X Add capability of doing "gsub" on a masked string
   X Need new "MaskedString" class?  
   X How to express the mask most conventiently?  
     X list of Range objects
   X Need unit tests
 X Add string masks to FortranLine
   X Add unit tests
 X Add masked gsub to FortranLine
   X Add unit tests
 X Add translations of real and complex declarations
   X Watch out for casts!
 X Add translations of [d*]d.[d*] and [d*].d[d*] where "d" is a digit [0-9].  
 X Add translations of odder things like 1.0d0, 3e4, a = b3e4zx
 X Add option to name kind "fp" (WRF) or "r8" (CCSM) or ...  
 X Deal with "IF ( x.gt.1 )" and other "." cases
 X Create test suite as described below


DISCUSSION

At one point while at CGD, I suggested building a bit of automation to handle 
all of the contributed code that did not use real(r8), 1.0_r8, etc.  Of 
course, we never got around to it (or to any of the much more substantive 
suggestions I made due to CCSM3.0 and IPCC ;-) ).  However, I am still 
convinced that it would be fairly easy to construct a bit of Perl regexp 
scripting to automate translation of real declarations to real(r8) and 
translate real literal constants to use the "r8" kind ("1.0" -> "1.0_r8").  I 
think this translator script would be very easy to test.  I'd use a simple sed 
script to rip all of the "r8" bits out of CCSM code, run the translator to put 
them all back, and diff vs. original.  With one more simple test file 
containing all of the stranger variants of real literals we'd have a solid 
unit test suite.  Then we could put the translator script in tools/ and add a 
bit to the Web document http://www.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/docs/wrf-phy.html 
that describes how to use the tool.  And we'd want to run the tool 
ourselves every so often to make sure we didn't accidentally forget to put the 
r8's in in new code.  That step could be part of the pre-check-in process. 

Of course, we'd want to change "r8" to something else!  Maybe "fp" 
(floating-point precision) or something else short. 

So, I think we can make it easy to use F90 "kind" for REAL and COMPLEX types.
